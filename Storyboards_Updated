These notes/updated storyboards of the narrative were created and updated after midterm feedback. I decided to go ahead with a great suggestion by a fellow peer Eileen on 
demonstrating each seperate body part, showing that fight or flight response. These notes are just to help me get direction with my project and be able to give myself
solid tasks to work on, to ensure progression over the week before the final piece is due as well as reminding me of certain objectives.

Notes created on 11/2/22:

Tasks to complete:

1. animate the sweatdrops to randomly move at different speeds, gradually increasing as the different scene progresses
2. add more background to the heart scene, have it going at a slower speed at first
3. create a scene that demonstrates a hand trembling
4. from there, figure out how to transition out different scenes depending on time
	- as time increases, each scene will come faster and it will go in between all three speeds very rapidly at the end
5. figure out how to create a more gradual increase shaking of each object, demonstrating them getting more scared
6. change the color of the face to go from blue to completely pale/white face by the end of the scene
7. create a scene at the end to appear that gives off a very ominous feeling such as the petrifying factor the indivdual is seeing
8. add comments !!!!!!! give explanation and clean up code !!!!!
9. review the code and submit to openprocessing - continue updating github repo

Storyboards in words:

* first scene starts off - face is normal - eyes begin to look around and move from left to left
* moves to heart beat going a little bit more than normal speed but not too noticable
* goes to hand slowly shaking
* transitions back to face starting to look a little bit more pale - eyes are bigger - face is trembling a little
* heartbeat is starting to go a little faster now definitely more noticable 
* hand is definitely trembling now, you can notice it shaking
* do two quick transitions between all of this so it emphasizes
* one final shot of the face - completely pale, eyes are huge, face is trembling 
* heartbeat is going super fast
* ends off with hand trembling so much 
* go quick between those screens quickly and finish off with a rapid black screen.
* sits for like 5 seconds at black and then a dark shadow of a figure appears 
* scene loops over - done
